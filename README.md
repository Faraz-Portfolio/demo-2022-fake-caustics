Fake stylized caustics efffect using Voronoi noise. This is a screen space efffect that is calculated within the bounds of its bounding cube.

## How it works

Buffers containing the color, position and normals of the target scene are rendered. Then, Voronoi noise is calculated for each point in the target scene. The noise is manipulated and shaped to resemble caustics. Then the noise is composited ontop of the target scene color.
